# React Project Documentation

  This documentation provides an overview of the React project, which includes the use of various technologies and libraries   for web application development. The project is built using React, Redux, Axios, Redux Toolkit, Redux Thunk, Redux Saga, TypeScript, Ant Design, Less, Lodash, Enzyme, and Storybook.
  
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Installation and Setup

* 1 Clone the project repository on your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

* 2 Navigate to the project directory:

## Technologies and Libraries Used

### React
React serves as the foundation of this project. It is used to create components and manage the application state.

### Redux + Thunk
Redux is used for state management in the application. Redux Thunk is used for handling asynchronous operations and side effects.

### Saga
Redux Saga is used for managing asynchronous operations, such as API requests and handling side effects.

### Axios
Axios is used for making API requests and fetching data.

### TypeScript
TypeScript is used to provide type safety and improve development experience.

### Ant Design
Ant Design is used for rapid development of styled UI components.

### Less
Less is used for writing the project's styles.

### Lodash
Lodash is used for working with lists and other data manipulation tasks.

### Enzyme
Enzyme is used for testing React components.

### Storybook
Storybook is used for component development and previewing in an isolated environment.

## Developing New Features
You can extend this project by adding new components, features, and pages as per your requirements. It is recommended to place new components in the src/components folder, create new Redux functionality in the src/features folder, and develop new pages and their components in their respective folders.

## Testing
This project includes an example of testing React components using Enzyme. You can create your own tests for components in the src/__tests__ folder.

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Storybook
This project includes Storybook, which allows you to develop and preview components in an isolated environment.

To start Storybook, run the following command:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

## Conclusion
The documentation provides a general overview of the React project, describes the use of various technologies and libraries, and provides instructions for installation, development of new features, testing, and using Storybook. You can use this documentation as a starting point for further expansion and development of the project.

### Happy coding!
